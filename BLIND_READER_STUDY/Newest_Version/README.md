A blind reader study was conducted using image slices from 15 randomly selected groups, each including brain and abdomen test sets with 14 pairs of images: an LDCT image, an NDCT image, and denoised LDCT images. Three board-certified radiologists, each with 15 years of experience, independently evaluated these images for noise reduction, contrast retention, and structure preservation using specific scoring systems. Noise reduction was assessed on a 1-14 point scale, with NDCT set at 7 points; scores above 7 indicated over-smoothing, while scores below 7 indicated insufficient noise reduction. Contrast retention and structural preservation were evaluated on a 1-5 point scale, with LDCT at 1 and NDCT at 5. Detailed evaluation criteria aimed to determine which images most closely resembled NDCT images, focusing on noise reduction, contrast retention, and structure preservation. The radiologists underwent preliminary reviews with non-test images to standardize their evaluations. The study found that MTD-GAN performed closest to NDCT in noise reduction for brain images and contrast retention for abdomen images, with competitive scores in other metrics. For comprehensive evaluation criteria and examples, see Appendix I-F. Table III shows the average and standard deviation of the blind test results per sample and per radiologist, indicating the superior performance of MTD-GAN in the evaluated metrics.
