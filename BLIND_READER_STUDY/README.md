# Evaluation criteria for the blind reader study. 

There are two versions of the blind reader study:
+ Old Version: This version was conducted during the first submission and involved two skilled radiologists. A 'ranking system,' which did not allow for duplicates, was used. This study focused only on the brain domain.

+ Newest Version: This expanded version of the blind reader study was conducted for the final submission. The expansions include the incorporation of predictions from Diffusion Models (DDPM, DDIM, PNDM, DPM), the inclusion of both brain and abdomen domains with 15 samples each, bringing the total to three board-certified radiologists with over 15 years of experience, and the replacement of the 'ranking system' with a 'scoring system' to address gaps caused by minor differences.
