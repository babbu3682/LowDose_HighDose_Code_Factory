# CSV files for evaluating statistical significance with p-values using a paired t-test.

As specified in "Section IV, B. Implementation Details" in our manuscirpt, the statistical significance of all experiments was assessed using the MedCalc software (Version 22.023). 

Paired t-tests were conducted for each metric, with the exception of the FID.

For transparency, we are providing real-time captures of the MedCalc statistical analyses (refer to Fig. A and B). 

As evident in Fig. A and B, MTD-GAN demonstrates statistically significant performance differences compared to the previous works on all metrics, with p-values lower than 0.0001, except with CTformer in terms of PSNR (p-value: 0.0255). 

Additionally, we plan to publish CSV files containing scores for each metric across all test samples on GitHub [üñáÔ∏èLink](https://github.com/babbu3682/MTD-GAN/tree/main/CSV_ZIP)
