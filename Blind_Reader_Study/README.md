# E. Blind Reader Study
It is currently incomplete. It will be updated in the future.<br/>

For credible qualitative evaluation, we conducted a blind-reader study using ten groups of image slices, randomly chosen from the brain test set. Each group comprised ten pairs of images, consisting of an LDCT image, NDCT image, and denoised LDCT image. 

Two board-certified radiologists, each with 15 years of experience in reading brain CT images, participated in this study using the blinding of the denoising techniques. They independently scored each denoised image on noise reduction, contrast retention, and structure preservation using a ten-point scale (1 = unacceptable, 10 = dominant).
